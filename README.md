Hey there,

This is just a small program that supports a fully functioning Arduino device that includes keycard detection and facial recognition. The website keeps track of each member and lets
other roommates know about their status. You can also manually change your status via the website. This is a work-in progress, many updates to come especially when it comes down to
aesthetics but it is nice to have a fully functioning program that makes it easier for my roommates and I to get in and out of my house! :)
